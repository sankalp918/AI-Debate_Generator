# Quick Start Guide - Enhanced Realistic Debates

## üöÄ Get Professional-Quality AI Debates in 5 Steps

### Step 1: Get Your ElevenLabs API Key (Recommended)
1. Go to [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io/) and sign up
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
4. Add your key: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key_here`

**Without ElevenLabs**: The system works fine with free gTTS, just less realistic.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Assets
```bash
    # Create directories
    mkdir -p assets output
    
    # Add images to assets folder
    # - assets/person1.jpg (first debater headshot)
    # - assets/person2.jpg (second debater headshot) 
    # - assets/podcast_background.jpg (optional - will auto-generate if missing)
```

**Image Tips**:
- Use clear, well-lit headshots
- Face should be clearly visible
- 1024x1024 recommended resolution
- Front-facing photos work best

### Step 3: Start Docker Services
```bash
  docker-compose up --build
```

Wait for all services to be healthy (about 2-3 minutes first time).

### Step 4: Setup SadTalker on Google Colab
1. Open `SadTalker_Colab.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Change runtime: Runtime ‚Üí Change runtime type ‚Üí A100 GPU
3. Run all cells (takes ~10 minutes first time)
4. Copy the ngrok URL that appears (e.g., `https://xxxx-xxxx.ngrok.io`)

**Important**: Follow `SADTALKER_UPGRADE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` to enable enhanced expressions!

### Step 5: Generate Your First Debate!
1. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
2. Enter a debate topic (e.g., "AI will improve healthcare")
3. Select number of rounds (1-3)
4. Paste your Colab ngrok URL
5. Click "Generate Debate"
6. Wait 5-10 minutes (depends on length)
7. Download your professional debate video!

### Voice Customization:
The system uses:

- **Person 2**: Bella (professional female voice)

To change voices, edit `tts/tts_service.py` and browse [ElevenLabs Voice Library](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library)

### Background Customization:
- Add `assets/podcast_background.jpg` for custom studio look
- Without it, auto-generates a professional gradient
- Use podcast studio images for authenticity

## üîç Troubleshooting

**"Connection refused" errors**
- Wait for Docker services to fully start (check with `docker-compose logs`)

**"ElevenLabs API error"**
- Check your API key in `.env`
- Verify you have credits in your ElevenLabs account
- System will auto-fallback to gTTS if there's an issue

**"No video generated"**
- Ensure Colab session is active
- Check ngrok URL is correct and working
- Look at Colab output for errors

**Videos look stiff/robotic**
- Apply enhanced SadTalker parameters (see `SADTALKER_UPGRADE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`)
- Increase `expression_scale` to 1.5 for more movement

**Slow generation**
- Use Colab Pro with A100 GPU
- Reduce to 1 round for faster testing
- Check if Colab disconnected
